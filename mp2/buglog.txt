1.      Date:2/10/2019
        Problem: 
           
            The draw_vert_line (int x) function doesn't work well, when trying to move right and left with arrow
            keys. The rest of the image is clearly not the rest of my screen.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution: 
            The offset of the addr is wrong, every time adding a new pixel we need to add SCROLL_X_WIDTH into the 
            offset.

2.      Date:3/10/2019
        Problem:
            After adding the status bar, the top and bottom of the screen is flickering. It seems two status bars are 
            shown on the screen
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            In the function set_mode_X, change the initial value of target_img from 0 to STATUS_BAR_SIZE.

3.      Date:3/10/2019
        Promblem:
            For adding the texts into the status bar, the characters are wrong but when the texts are in the middle, it's correct!!!
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            When calling the show_status_bar, I forgot to add a "()" after calling the get_typed_command() function and use the game_info.where
            without room_name().
        Time taken: ~45mins

4.      Date:3/10/2019
        Promblem:
            When typing texts into the status bar, the texts are flickering, but the given texts shown on the left or the middle of the
            screen are correct.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng 
        solution:
            Everytime the show_status_bar function is called, it will cover the status bar with the backgrond color and then 
            write the texts into it. Therefore, once we update the status bar, it will clear the texts and then write them, which
            will cause the status bar flickering. To solve it, we need to change the constructure of our functions. Seperate the 
            copy buffer function and the update buffer function. Call them one by one but no one inside the other.

5.      Date:4/10/2019
        Problem:
            When adding the underline on the right of the status bar, the underline looks like an "O".
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            Can not just add a "_" string in the last of the test array, but use the ASCII nuber(95, or 0x5F) of the underline.

********************************** checkpoint 2.2 **********************************
1.      Date:9/10/2019
        Problem:
            When type su -c ./adventure, the program turn off automaticly and no message printed.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            After gdb, I find that when calculating the Level 2 palette, some colors count number are 0, so 
            when calculate the average R,G,B, it will divide the count. In other words, it divides 0. I just 
            need to add a if condition, once the loop meets the 0 count, it countinues the loop.

2.      Date:9/10/2019
        Problem:
            Can not enter the game.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            After gdb, I find I read the piexel twice. So I create an array to store each pixel during the first
            iteration. 
        Time taken: 20mins    

2.      Date:9/10/2019
        Problem:
            The image can be shown on the screen but the color is quite strange, and it doesn't contain
            to many colors.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            The palette I set is correct, but when I set the 8 bit pointer to the p->img, i forgot to add 64 into it.
            Therefore the image shown on the screen used the first 64 based color before optimized instead. That's why
            its color looks like dull. The solution is just to add 64 into the index.

1.      Date:9/12/2019
        Problem:
            When press the reset, the LEDs don't response, and I find in the kernel space, printk is not runed
            in anywhere
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            I compiled my code in the dev but not the test-debug
        Time taken: 4hrs 

2.      Date:9/13/2019
        Problem:
            The LEDs always show "OOPS" and can not be changed.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            Everytime I set the buff and sent it to the Tux in set LED function, the size of the buff
            is always 6. And in the test case, only 3 LEDs are need to work, so the buffer size should be 
            equal to 2 + #working_LED. 
        Time taken: 3hrs 

3.      Date:9/13/2019
        Problem:
            When typing the button of the Tux board, the A, B, C button will be not changed if the previous
            type is the same button.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            for the default case, i forgot to reset the previous command into CMD_NONE. The solution is just 
            to add it.
        Time taken: 10mins 

3.      Date:9/13/2019
        Problem:
            Can not control the game with the TUX controller.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            Just forget to use call my get_tux_command() function in adventure !!
        Time taken: 70mins

4.      Date:9/13/2019
        Problem:
            The game window controled by the Tux gets stuck, and once I type the direction, it will stop a while
            and then the window will approach to the edge.
        reported by: Lin Hangzheng
        Resolved by: Lin Hangzheng
        solution:
            I didn't set the buttons_pressed to 0 before the thread done one loop. And I detect the button type (direction or ABC)
            twice, which makes my code mass and overload the condition check variable.
